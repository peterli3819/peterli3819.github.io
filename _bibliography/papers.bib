abstract  ="The discovery and development of new low reduction potential molecules that also have fast charge transfer kinetics is necessary for the further development of organic redox-active polymers in practical battery applications. Theoretical methods can aid in finding the lead radical candidates in large initial screening spaces{,} but low-cost (yet accurate) methods are needed to predict the functional properties of the materials. In this paper{,} we conduct a two-objective (potential and dimer electronic coupling) virtual screening campaign to identify lead low potential candidate molecules in an initial space of 660 candidate molecules. The screening is accelerated by employing a trained Gaussian Process regression model for the voltage screening task. The model takes a combination of core-group chemical fingerprints and low-cost semi-empirical quantum chemistry calculations as the features for the model. The top-10%-predicted lowest reduction potential molecules of the initial space are then screened further to identify the candidates with the highest predicted electronic coupling. From the screening campaign{,} a set of promising redox-active molecules and two Pareto-optimal molecules (both N-methylphthalimides) are identified.",
