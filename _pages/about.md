Hi!ðŸ™‚ I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry at Texas A&M University, under supervision by [Dr. Daniel Tabor](https://www.chem.tamu.edu/faculty/daniel-tabor/) starting in 2019.

My research interests fall under the intersection of `Machine Learning` and `Computational Chemistry`, where I mainly focus on:

<ul>
    <li>Unravelling structureâ€”property relationship and dynamics of redox-active polymers in organic radical batteries using molecular dynamics simulations</li>
    <li>Multi-objective high-throughput screening for redox-active molecules assisted by machine learning techniques</li>
    <li>Development of physics-informed machine learning techniques for chemistry applications</li>
</ul>
